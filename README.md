# 42-header-script
I gentleman of the prestigious 42 school, created (with a tiny little help of AI) this wonderful script that 
generates for you a header of the 42 school. 

# Setup
First clone the repository.


_ Then make the script executable
`chmod +x ./header.sh`.


_ Add the two next lines into your terminal source file.
`export MAIL='yourmail@maildomain.edu`
`export USER='yourlogin'`
    This will change the script USER and MAIL.


for example zsh :
`nano ~/.zshrc`

<add the above two lines then save.>
Source the file.
`source ~/.zshrc`
You are now ready to use it .
# Usage 

`./header.sh <file>`
Will add/update the file header.
